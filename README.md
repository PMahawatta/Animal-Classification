# Animal-Classification
The project's goal is to create an animal image classifier that could achieve the 
desired accuracy in dense forest environments, and to help ecologists and 
researchers in neural network/artificial intelligence & zoological domains to 
further study and/or improve habitat, environmental, and extinction pat. 


Objectives –

Ø Create a CNN model to find similar features in images belonging to different 
classes and using them to identify and label images. (Classification of animal 
images) 

Ø Evaluate the loss and accuracy of the model.
